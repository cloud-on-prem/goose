This is a rust project with crates in crate dir. 

ui/desktop has an electron app in typescript. 

tips: 
- can look at unstaged changes for what is being worked on if starting
- always check rust compiles, cargo fmt etc and cargo clippy -- -D warnings (as well as run tests in files you are working on)
- in ui/desktop, look at how you can run lint checks and if other tests can run
